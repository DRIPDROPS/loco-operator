# PR Description

## Summary of Changes

This PR introduces several updates and improvements to the local-operator project, focusing on enhancing security, model configuration, and prompt management. Key changes include:

- **Enhanced Security:** Implemented safety checks for code execution using a language model to identify potentially dangerous operations. This includes new prompts and logic in `local_operator/executor.py` and `local_operator/prompts.py` to analyze code safety and get user confirmation when needed.
- **Updated Model Configuration:** Modified model configurations in `local_operator/model/configure.py` and `local_operator/model/registry.py` to include a `recommended` flag for models and providers. This allows for better model selection and management.
- **Improved Prompt Management:** Updated prompts in `local_operator/prompts.py` to provide more context and guidance to the agent.
- **API Updates:** Updated the API to include model recommendation information and sorting options.

## Impact

- **Security:** This change introduces safety checks for code execution, reducing the risk of executing dangerous code.
- **Model Management:** The `recommended` flag in model configurations allows for better model selection and management.
- **API:** The API has been updated to include model recommendation information and sorting options.

## Testing Details

- These changes were tested by running the existing unit tests and integration tests.
- Specific scenarios validated include:
    - Code execution with and without safety checks.
    - Model configuration with and without the `recommended` flag.
    - API calls with and without the new query parameters.
