# Product Requirements Document: Python-Based Modular Crypto Wallet

## Introduction
## Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a new Python-based modular crypto wallet supporting Sui and Ethereum initially, with features for chain switching, portfolio tracking, intelligent auto trading, and transaction sending. The app is desktop-based with mobile capabilities, emphasizing modularity, security, and scalability.

## Functional Requirements
## Functional Requirements
- Modular support for blockchains (starting with Sui using Move and Ethereum using web3.py).
- Manual chain switching via user interface.
- Automatic chain switching based on token selection in the portfolio.
- Portfolio tracker to manage assets and token metadata.
- Intelligent auto trader using basic AI patterns from prior searches for decision-making.
- Transaction sender with secure handling of keys and validations.
- Desktop UI with mobile app integration using frameworks like Kivy.

## Non-Functional Requirements
## Non-Functional Requirements
- Security: Implement input validation, encryption for keys, and OAuth for authentication.
- Performance: Optimize for fast chain switching and trading decisions.
- Maintainability: Modular code with clear docstrings and tests.
- Scalability: Design to easily add new blockchains.
- Usability: Intuitive UI for desktop and mobile.

## Architecture and Design
## Architecture and Design
- Use a base interface for blockchain modules (e.g., BlockchainInterface class).
- Main app orchestrates modules, with separate files for Sui and Ethereum implementations.
- Configuration management via JSON files for chain settings.

## Security Considerations
## Security Considerations
- Validate all inputs to prevent injections.
- Use secure storage for private keys (e.g., via libraries like cryptography).
- Implement logging and error handling for potential breaches.

## User Experience (UX) Guidelines
## User Experience (UX) Guidelines
- Simple dashboard for chain selection and portfolio view.
- Alerts for auto trading decisions.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.

## Integrations and Dependencies
## Integrations and Dependencies
- Dependencies: web3.py for Ethereum, Sui SDK for Sui, pytest for testing, pylint for linting.
- Integrations: Use APIs from Etherscan and Sui for token data.

## Testing and Validation
## Testing and Validation
- Unit tests for each module using pytest.
- Integration tests for chain switching and trading logic.
- Linting with pylint after each code change.
