Exploratory Data Analysis of MPG Dataset

1. Dataset Overview:
   - Total Entries: 398
   - Features: mpg, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model_year, origin, name

2. Key Statistics:
   - Average MPG: 23.51
   - Average Horsepower: 104.47
   - Average Weight: 2970.42 lbs
   - Average Acceleration: 15.57

3. Visualizations:
   - Distribution of MPG: The distribution shows that most vehicles have MPG between 15 and 30.
   - MPG by Number of Cylinders: Vehicles with 4 cylinders tend to have higher MPG compared to those with 6 or 8 cylinders.
   - MPG vs Weight: There is a negative correlation between weight and MPG; heavier vehicles generally have lower MPG.
   - MPG vs Horsepower: There is a slight negative correlation between horsepower and MPG; higher horsepower vehicles tend to have lower MPG.

4. Conclusion:
   - The analysis indicates that vehicle weight and horsepower negatively impact fuel efficiency (MPG). Vehicles with fewer cylinders generally have better fuel efficiency.
