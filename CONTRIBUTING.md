## Dependency Graph

Refer to the [dependency graph](docs/dependencies.md) for a visual representation of the project structure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Dependencies in requirements.txt

### Development Setup

1. If you don't have contributor access, **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/local-operator.git
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

## Code Style & Quality

We enforce consistent code style and quality checks:

- **Formatting**: Uses black and isort

  ```bash
  black .
  isort .
  ```

- **Linting**: Uses flake8

  ```bash
  flake8
  ```

- **Type Checking**: Uses pyright

  ```bash
  pyright
  ```

- **Dependency Scanning**: Uses pip-audit

  ```bash
  pip-audit
  ```

Always run these tools before submitting a pull request.  They will also be run in the CI pipeline on any branches with the `dev-` prefix and on PRs merged to `main`.

## Testing

We use pytest for testing with async support:

```bash
pytest
```

- Keep tests in the tests/ directory
- Aim for 80%+ test coverage for new features
- Mark async tests with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`

## Contribution Workflow

Please follow the following steps to contribute:

1. For accounts without contributor access, create your fork of the repository
2. Create a new branch for your changes with the `dev-` prefix

   ```bash
   git checkout -b dev-my-feature
   # or
   git checkout -b dev-issue-number-description
   ```

3. Commit changes with descriptive messages
   - Use the present tense
   - Keep commits small and atomic

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature for specific component"
   ```

4. Update documentation if adding new features or changing behavior

5. Push your changes to your fork

   ```bash
   git push origin dev-my-feature
   ```

6. Create a Pull Request against the main branch of the upstream repository

## Release Process

Once approved and merged, maintainers will package changes into releases with the following procedure:

1. Update the version in `pyproject.toml`
2. Create a git tag with prefix `v` (for example `v0.2.0`)
3. Push the tag to the upstream repository on the commit to release on `main`
4. Create a release from the tag on GitHub with a concise release name and a description of the changes
5. CD will trigger on release creation and package and upload the version in `pyproject.toml` to PyPI

**For pre-release versions**:

- Use the `ax` or `bx` suffix (for example `v0.2.0a1`)
- Update the version in `pyproject.toml` on the `dev-` branch
- Releases can be created by maintainers from the `dev-` branch if they are not ready to be merged to main

## Pull Request Checklist

- Tests added/updated
- Documentation updated (README, docstrings)
- Code formatted with black and isort
- Linting passes (flake8)
- Type checking passes (pyright)
- All CI checks pass
- Security considerations addressed (for code execution features)

## Reporting Issues

When filing an issue, please include:

1. Local Operator version
2. Python version
3. Hosting platform (DeepSeek/Ollama/OpenAI)
4. Steps to reproduce
5. Expected vs actual behavior
6. Error logs (if applicable)

## Security Considerations

For features involving code execution or system operations:

- Clearly document security implications
- Maintain safety checks and user confirmations
- Add tests for potentially dangerous operations
- Follow principle of least privilege in file/system access

## Feature Requests

We welcome innovative ideas! When proposing new features:

- Explain the use case and target audience
- Outline potential implementation strategy
- Discuss security implications
- Suggest documentation needs

## Documentation

Help us improve documentation by:

- Fixing typos/outdated information
- Adding usage examples
- Updating the dependency graph in `docs/dependencies.md`
- Improving section organization
- Translating documentation (if applicable)

## Need Help?

Join our Discussions to:

- Ask questions about implementation
- Discuss architectural decisions
- Propose major changes before coding
- Share your use cases
