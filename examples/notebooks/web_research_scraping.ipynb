    "ü§ñ **Assistant**: ### Detailed Plan to Download the Canadian Sanctions List to a CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Gather Information about the User's Goal\n",
    "- **Objective**: Download the Canadian sanctions list and ensure all records are included in a CSV file.\n",
    "- **Source**: The Canadian sanctions list is typically available from the Government of Canada's website or an official API.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Break Down the Goal into Smaller, Manageable Steps\n",
    "1. **Research the Source of the Canadian Sanctions List**\n",
    "   - Identify the official source of the Canadian sanctions list.\n",
    "   - Determine if the list is available in a downloadable format (e.g., CSV, JSON, or API).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Download the Sanctions List**\n",
    "   - Use the identified source to download the list.\n",
    "   - If the list is available via an API, use the `requests` library to fetch the data.\n",
    "   - If the list is available as a downloadable file, use the `requests` library to download it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Convert the Data to CSV Format**\n",
    "   - If the data is not already in CSV format, convert it to CSV.\n",
    "   - Use the `pandas` library to handle the conversion and ensure all records are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Save the CSV File**\n",
    "   - Save the CSV file to the local filesystem.\n",
    "   - Verify that the file has been saved correctly and contains all records.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Verify the Data**\n",
    "   - Check the number of records in the CSV file to ensure all records are present.\n",
    "   - Perform a quick data validation to ensure the data is in the expected format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Identify the Tools and Resources Needed for Each Step\n",
    "- **Research the Source**:\n",
    "  - Use the `search_web` tool to find the official source of the Canadian sanctions list.\n",
    "- **Download the Sanctions List**:\n",
    "  - Use the `requests` library to fetch the data.\n",
    "- **Convert the Data to CSV Format**:\n",
    "  - Use the `pandas` library to handle the conversion.\n",
    "- **Save the CSV File**:\n",
    "  - Use the `pandas` library to save the file.\n",
    "- **Verify the Data**:\n",
    "  - Use the `pandas` library to read the CSV file and perform validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Determine the Order in Which the Steps Should Be Executed\n",
    "1. Research the source of the Canadian sanctions list.\n",
    "2. Download the sanctions list.\n",
    "3. Convert the data to CSV format.\n",
    "4. Save the CSV file.\n",
    "5. Verify the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Create a Detailed Plan That Outlines Each Step, the Tools/Resources Required, and the Expected Outcome\n",
    "1. **Research the Source of the Canadian Sanctions List**\n",
    "   - **Action**: Use the `search_web` tool to find the official source of the Canadian sanctions list.\n",
    "   - **Tools**: `search_web`\n",
    "   - **Expected Outcome**: Identify the URL or API endpoint for the Canadian sanctions list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Download the Sanctions List**\n",
    "   - **Action**: Use the `requests` library to fetch the data from the identified source.\n",
    "   - **Tools**: `requests`\n",
    "   - **Expected Outcome**: Download the sanctions list data in a suitable format (e.g., JSON, XML).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Convert the Data to CSV Format**\n",
    "   - **Action**: Use the `pandas` library to convert the data to CSV format.\n",
    "   - **Tools**: `pandas`\n",
    "   - **Expected Outcome**: A CSV file containing all records from the sanctions list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Save the CSV File**\n",
    "   - **Action**: Use the `pandas` library to save the CSV file to the local filesystem.\n",
    "   - **Tools**: `pandas`\n",
    "   - **Expected Outcome**: A CSV file saved to the local filesystem.\n",

    "   - **Action**: Use the `pandas` library to read the CSV file and perform validation.\n",
    "   - **Tools**: `pandas`\n",
    "   - **Expected Outcome**: Verification that the CSV file contains all records and is in the expected format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Create a Validation Plan for How You Will Check That Each Step is Successful and That the Overall Goal is Achieved at the End\n",
    "1. **Research the Source**\n",
    "   - **Validation**: Ensure the URL or API endpoint is correct and accessible.\n",
    "2. **Download the Sanctions List**\n",
    "   - **Validation**: Check the response status code and ensure the data is downloaded successfully.\n",
    "3. **Convert the Data to CSV Format**\n",
    "   - **Validation**: Ensure the data is converted to CSV format without errors.\n",
    "4. **Save the CSV File**\n",
    "   - **Validation**: Verify that the CSV file is saved to the local filesystem and contains data.\n",
    "5. **Verify the Data**\n",
    "   - **Validation**: Check the number of records in the CSV file and perform a quick data validation to ensure the data is in the expected format.\n",
