    "1. **Identify the Conversation History**\n",
    "   - **Action**: Gather all the conversation history, including the user's requests, the assistant's responses, and the code executed.\n",
    "   - **Tools**: The `save_conversation_history_to_notebook` function from the `tools` registry.\n",
    "   - **Expected Outcome**: A comprehensive record of the conversation, including all the steps taken, code executed, and outputs generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create the IPython Notebook File**\n",
    "   - **Action**: Use the `save_conversation_history_to_notebook` function to save the conversation history to an IPython notebook file.\n",
    "   - **Tools**: `save_conversation_history_to_notebook` function.\n",
    "   - **Expected Outcome**: An IPython notebook file (`titanic_conversation.ipynb`) that contains all the steps, code, and outputs of the current session.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify the Notebook Content**\n",
    "   - **Action**: Open the generated notebook file to ensure that it contains all the necessary information and is correctly formatted.\n",
    "   - **Tools**: `pandas` for reading the notebook file and `tools.list_working_directory` to verify the file's presence.\n",
    "   - **Expected Outcome**: The notebook file should be well-structured, with all the steps, code, and outputs clearly visible and correctly formatted.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Summarize the Results**\n",
    "   - **Action**: Provide a summary of the notebook file and the steps taken to create it.\n",
    "   - **Tools**: Natural language for summarization.\n",
    "   - **Expected Outcome**: A clear and detailed summary of the notebook file, including its location and contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Validation Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the Conversation History**\n",
    "   - **Check**: Ensure that all the conversation history is gathered and includes user requests, assistant responses, and code execution.\n",
    "   - **Method**: Review the conversation history and ensure it is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create the IPython Notebook File**\n",
    "   - **Check**: Ensure that the notebook file is created and saved correctly.\n",
    "   - **Method**: Use the `save_conversation_history_to_notebook` function and verify the file's presence in the working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify the Notebook Content**\n",
    "   - **Check**: Ensure that the notebook file contains all the necessary information and is correctly formatted.\n",
